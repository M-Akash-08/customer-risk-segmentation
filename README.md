# Customer Risk Segmentation & Scoring

## Problem Statement
Identifying high-risk customers is essential for proactive risk management.
This project builds a customer risk segmentation and scoring approach using
behavioral and transactional data.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer-level attributes such as transaction frequency,
account age, and usage behavior.

## Approach
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand customer behavior
- Applied clustering techniques to segment customers into risk groups
- Built classification models to identify high-risk customers
- Evaluated model performance using standard classification metrics

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Steps
1. Data preprocessing and EDA
2. Customer segmentation using clustering
3. Risk classification using ML models
4. Feature importance analysis

## Results
The approach successfully segmented customers into meaningful risk categories
and identified key behavioral indicators associated with higher risk.

## Notes
This project emphasizes interpretability and analytical reasoning over
complex model architectures.
